          <p>Monadic Party is a five-days long Haskell summer school. Our vision is to teach in depth with each talk spanning multiple sessions. Because of the additional time at our disposal we can get deeper into each topic to show a larger part of the story behind the subject. The size will be capped at fifty attendees to provide you with a good learning experience.</p>

          <p>We will have two tracks, one for programmers that aren't experienced in Haskell and would like to learn it from the basic concepts. The other track is for people already familiar with the language and will present a selection of talks and workshops on a variety of topics. We will announce the list of topics after our call for speakers closes at the end of February.</p>

          <p>We chose Poznan to host the summer school because of its architecture, culture and nightlife. The venue is a recently restored lovely old building at <a href='http://mlynska12.pl/' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a> where we have the whole highest floor at our disposal. So the only thing you need is a ticket, laptop and a place to sleep and you're good to go. Catered lunch, tea and coffee is included in the ticket price.</p>

          <h2 class='title left'><span class='first'>G</span>etting <span class='second'>T</span>here</h2>

          <p>We will hold the summer school at <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/DMHV2GN2Nk12' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a>, Poznan, Poland. The venue is in the Old Town, a walking distance from a town square. We would love to help you with choosing a place to stay. If you have any questions, please email us at <a href='mailto:team@monadic.party'>team@monadic.party</a>.</p>

          <p>In terms of travel, <a href='https://wizzair.com' target='_blank'>WizzAir</a>, <a href='https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/' target='_blank'>Ryanair</a>, <a href='https://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage' target='_blank'>Lufthansa</a> and <a href='http://www.lot.com/gb/en' target='_blank'>LOT</a> all have a dense network of daily connections to and from the city. If you want to save some carbon dioxide, there are frequent train connections from Germany and inside Poland. Buses are also a good budget option with <a href='http://www.polskibus.com/en/index.htm' target='_blank'>PolskiBus</a> which operates a lot of routes in the region.</p>

          <p>Inside the city of Poznan there is a good <a href='http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/en/#planner' target='_blank'>public transporation system</a> with a dense network throughout the city.</p>

              <p>We're the organizers of <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Monadic-Warsaw/' target='_blank'>Monadic Warsaw</a>, Ewa Kruzynska and <a href='https://twitter.com/monad_cat' target='_blank'>Michal Kawalec</a>. With over five hundred members it grew up to be one of the biggest Haskell meetups in Europe. We've had speakers and visitors from all over the world and we also host a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeiYYR2fCXarkfSqqFBwuA' target='_blank'>YouTube channel</a>. It is our way of popularizing functional programming and building a community of interested people. We are sure the summer school will give us as much fun as Monadic Warsaw.

                <div class='bio'>
We will present an introduction to Category Theory for a Haskell
programmer.  We will introduce basic notions of category theory together
with their counterparts in Haskell.  We will try to fill the course with
interesting and useful examples taken from both worlds: of pure
mathematics and Haskell.  We will introduce the notions of category
theory, functors and natural transformations, universal properties and
adjoint functors.  We will consider initial objects, and the notion of
freeness.  If time permits we will show how initial F-algebras give rise
to recursive schemes in an elegant an elementary way and how GADTs can
be constructed via Yoneda Lemma.

                <div class='bio'>
                  I want people to walk away feeling confident that they're capable of deploying Haskell apps to a server. So in the first half or so we'll install nix, use nix-deploy to get a demo app running, and learn enough about nix to get a sense of what's going on. In the second half I'd like to iterate on that with a real life project project.

                <h4>Web development with Servant and ReasonML</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                    Haskell specifically and functional programming in general brings many promises to the table in web development. In this series of workshops and lectures I will present how reliable and fun it can be. We will write servers with Servant and interfaces in ReasonML. The intention is for attendees to leave with enough knowledge to easily write common web services in a typesafe manner. On the frontend side we will learn how ReasonML can help with creating robust interfaces we can rely on and reason about.<br /><br />

                    This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with web development in any technology and an intermediate knowledge of Haskell.

                <div class='bio'>
                    Over the course of the week, we'll work on gaining a deep understanding of Haskell's type and typeclass system and how they allow us to think about code algebraically. We'll explore functors in great detail, coming to understand the similarities and differences of the most important functors, ending with a look at contravariant functors, profunctors, and how profunctors are used to great effect in the SQL-generating library, `opaleye.`

                <div class='bio'>
                    This will be a gentle conceptual introduction to dependent types. I'll cover motivation, how well-known constructions generalize to dependent types, using types to guide program writing, dependent pattern matching, constructivism and the law of excluded middle, code examples where dependent types fit well.
The tutorial assumes intermediate familiarity with Haskell, but otherwise requires no background about type systems.

                <h4>An Introduction to Software Transactional Memory</h4>

                    Traditionally, programming with shared-memory concurrency is difficult and error prone. Data-races and threading bugs are difficult to detect and reason about. If you get things right after a lot of fiddling with locks, your code will be a hard to read mess.

Software Transactional Memory makes techniques pioneered in relational databases available to your application. During a series of workshops and lectures, we will discuss what STM is, how it works, and how you can use it to get composable concurrency control. Make your applications faster without pulling your hair out (as much).

                    The talks will form a complete introduction to testing in Haskell. They will cover the different kinds of tests, and how to write them in Haskell, best practices and generators and their best practices. It will be a combination of lectures and hands-on workshops.

                <div class='bio'>
                    Serverless is an emerging model of clouding computing which abstracts
away all the task regarding server maintenance and resource provision,
and Azure Functions is Microsoft's serveless platform.  While Haskell
is not an officially supported language for developing on top of Azure
Functions, we will see how to mitigate that shortcoming and write some
a simple Haskell serverless application.  Finally, we will explore
some of Azure offerings for more complex scenarios.

                <h4>From NAND To Lambda: Foundational Computing from Functional Principles</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                  My talk will be a series of mixed lectures with workshops that will introduce students to fundamental concepts of computer hardware using Haskell!  This sounds like a heavy duty course, and it is, but I will break down these concepts into approachable pieces with a logical progression from basic logic gates to parsing a simple assembly language! It is heavily inspired by this <a href='http://nand2tetris.org'>Nand to Tetris</a> course, but will present the concepts through the lens (pun only slightly intended) of Haskell programming, rather than the imperative programming that is taught through much of the course.

                    Talk will show neural networks as a motivating examples to introduce few intermediately advanced topics such as RankNTypes, GADTs, ScopedTypeVariables extensions as well as using category theory to describe programming problem. Ale these topics will be presented with in-depth formal explanation while showing how to write neural networks library from scratch using great 'hmatrix' and 'ad' libraries.

                <h4>Really Real-World Haskell (for Machine Learning Evaluation)</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                    In this series of workshops, you'll help me to develop cool features for Gonito.net, an open-source platform for machine learning competitions, and GEval, its companion command-line tool for evaluating machine learning systems — real stuff to be used by Machine Learning people (not necessarily Haskellers). I want you to see how easy and fun Haskell programming can be (with the right
abstractions). We will cover things useful in practise (error handling, Web applications, conduits, database programming, monadic parsing, handling command-line options), which will take you from zero knowledge of Haskell straight to the intermediate level.

Basic coding skills (in any programming language) are required. However, no knowledge of machine learning is needed (actually, you will learn its titbits, as a by-product of this course).

                <h4>Modeling protocols with linear dependent types</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
                  Learn how concurrent functional programming is exactly a proof language for full linear logic, fancy protocol modeling  using coinductive programming, along with first class ownership and authorization.
Example modeling will span replication algorithms, various  authorization models, library books, pen&paper rpg systems,
and some of the more elementary financial/business structures that usually lack good abstractions! Also try out your own modelling and learn how its implemented!

participants should be comfortable with gadts, concurrent haskell programming, and writing code in Agda or a similar proof assistant. Compiler hacking or immature PL implementation experimentation a plus :)

This sequence synthesizes several years of industrial research towards building the tools we wish "blockchain" actually was! :)

                    <h4> Reactive programming, bananas, robots, what do you want more?</h4>
                <div class='bio'>
We live in an inherently reactive world, Newton already knew this in the 17th century and became famous by formulating this idea as a law. The programming language world is also slowly realising that reactivity should be a first class language construct.  Frameworks like Angular and Reactive extensions are popping up like mushrooms. Like many groundbreaking language features reactive programming had its origins in the functional programming world. In this talk I will give a gentle introduction to the world of functional reactive programming. Starting from the main principles we will build our own reactive programming library. Once we have done that we will look into a state of the art library and implement a simple  game. To put the cherry on the cake we will implement a small reactive program to control an MBot (educational robot).
