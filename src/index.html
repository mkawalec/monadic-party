          <h2 class='title right'><span class='first'>A</span>bout the <span class='second'>e</span>vent</h2>
          <p>Monadic Party is a four-days long Haskell summer school. Our vision is to teach in depth with each talk taking between four and six sessions. There are three tracks, one for beginners in Haskell and two aimed at intermediate to advanced Haskell programmers.

          <p>For attendees that arrive on the 15th, we have a preparty lined up.</p>

          <p>The venue is a recently restored lovely old building at <a href='http://mlynska12.pl/' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a> where we have the whole highest floor at our disposal. The only thing you need is a ticket, laptop and a place to sleep and you're good to go. Catered lunch, tea and coffee is included in the ticket price.</p>

          <h2 class='title left'><span class='first'>G</span>etting <span class='second'>T</span>here</h2>

          <p>When traveling from ZuriHac, we highly recommend taking a train to help the environment a bit. There is a train on the 15th of June, leaving Zurich at 9am and arriving in Poznań at 8:27pm (changes in Basel and Berlin). When buying well in advance, it costs 99,90 Euros. You can book it <a href='https://www.bahn.com/en/view/index.shtml' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

          <p>We will hold the summer school at <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/DMHV2GN2Nk12' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a>, Poznan, Poland. The venue is in the Old Town, a walking distance from the town square. We would love to help you with choosing a place to stay. If you have any questions, please email us at <a href='mailto:team@monadic.party'>team@monadic.party</a>.</p>

          <p>Inside the city of Poznan there is a good <a href='http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/en/#planner' target='_blank'>public transporation system</a> with a dense network throughout the city.</p>

              <h2 class='title right'><span class='first'>S</span>cholarship <span class='second'>P</span>rogramme</h2>

              <p>We are deligted to offer a means based scholarship programme. If you are unable to attend the summer school because of financial reasons, we have a number of fully funded places available. Everything needed for you to attend is covered - travel to the event, accommodation and the ticket itself.</p>

              <p>The scholarship applications are now closed, if you have applied, expect a message from us between 23rd and 27th of March.</p>

                <p>This track consists of a crash introduction to Haskell, in two parts of theory and practice. In the theory, we start from scratch and finish with the concepts of functions, type classes and algebraic data types. Armed with this knowledge we switch to the exercise track where we will implement two small games: Snake and Tetris. We will be using an online exercise platform which will guide you through the various stages of implementing the games.</p>

                <p>During this workshop we will solve a single problem: building a Reliable, Scalable, Maintainable SPA (single page application).
Or we will learn how to go from 75K+ React Beast, that is flaky, builds slow, size >1Mb, and scares away newcomers (me), to a "yay I can go to work" Elm app</p>

<p>Four months ago I joined a startup and I very much enjoy the work.
During this short period we developed 50k+ line backend service, with 1000+ tests that take &lt;2m to run, that is a pleasure to work with, refactor and extend.</p>

<p>Sadly the frontend 75k+ line app we developed was a problem for business, and developers.
The biggest pains it has (imho) are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>build times ( CI takes 4x 15-20min ).</li>
  <li></li>
  <li>production errors (undefined is not an object, null is not an object and even more hairier ones).</li>
  <li>typeless (pure js) -> refactoring is not an option.</li>
  <li>1.5Mb + bundle sizes.</li>
  <li>i hate this code feeling.</li>
  <li>what does this application do? (hard to tell without reading it all).</li>
</ul>

<p>If any/many of these sound like pains you have/had, I encourage you to join this workshop and learn a new way how these problem can be solved.
During the workshop You will:</p>
<ul>
  <li>learn how to build a SPA in Elm.</li>
  <li>learn how strong guarantees that Elm provides solve above pains.</li>
  <li>as a sideeffect, gain a lot of FP knowledge.</li>
  <li>see how Elm makes coding fun.</li>
  <li>make you not want to go back to working in any other frontend technology.</li>
</ul>

              <div class='abstract'>
                <p>We need an understanding how to build real-world applications in Haskell. This is the biggest demand from the Haskell community according to the yearly surveys. We need design approaches, software architectures, best practices and design principles. We need not just a set of distinct ideas but rather a complete methodology of how to build complex applications that will be manageable, testable, simple. Many approaches emerged from the Haskell world recently: Final Tagless, ReaderT pattern, Service Handle pattern, effect systems. But my approach is based on Hierarchical Free Monads, my own methodology that I successfully used in several companies.</p>

<p>In the workshop, you’ll learn how to use Free monads for layering your application, for designing subsystems, for separating interfaces and implementation. You’ll know how to add support of SQL DB, implement logging, add external services interaction. You’ll know how to create a REST servant-based backend that will be using your business logic for doing stuff. You’ll see that the Free monadic approach allows you to do functional and integration testing easily.</p>

                <p>In the age of dependent types low-level guts of Haskell are often overlooked. Most of us grew fascinated by polymorphism, functors and effect systems and never looked back. This talk is an invitation to go deeper, back to the very roots and discover primitive operations below.
Participants will learn how to operate on unboxed data and primitive arrays, and combine them with the high-level code, aiming for better performance and - even more important - relaxing pressure on garbage collector. Topics covered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lifted and unlifted, boxed and unboxed data. Basics of levity polymorphism. Strict and lazy pattern-matching, understanding of GHC strictness analysis. Introduction to Core language.</li>
  <li>Low-level arithmetic of fixed and arbitrary precision. Low-level comparisons. Allocations and how to avoid them. Writing bindings to `libgmp`. Examples: modular exponentiation, factorials.</li>
  <li>Crash course of bit fiddling, covering reversals, population count, leading/trailing zeros, parallel deposit and extraction. How to handle different architectures? Examples: boolean polynomial.</li>
  <li>Raw arrays and memory access. Mutable and immutable arrays. Introduction to `primitive` package. Atomic updates in multi-threaded environment. Examples: table lookups, bit sets.</li>

In this workshop you'll learn how to use Haskell and Rust together to build blazingly fast programs while keeping your sanity.</p>

<p>We'll start by covering the basics of Rust, how to call it from Haskell via FFI, and performance testing methods to make sure you're using the right language in the right place. Then we'll use a small game made in pure Rust to go hands-on with advanced topics including session types and parallel processing. You’ll leave the workshop unafraid to mix in a dash of Rust whenever your project could benefit.</p>

<p>Given that more and more countries are pushing for electronic voting, to reduce the cost of this process, but for the most, not always getting it right from either of the four pillars of voting: Functionality, Security, Resilience and Trust seen from the perspectives of Law, Society and Technology.</p>

<p>We would therefore like to provide a "real" open source implementation, copyleft licensed, that doesn't need to be hidden under a "legal wall" as for example a solution provided by the Postal service of a country known for its watches and chocolate. The approach will be based on the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP), since Haskell is among the very few programming languages that can enforce this at compile-time, which should provide more trustable and auditable software.</p>
