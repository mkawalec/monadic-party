          <h2 class='title right'><span class='first'>A</span>bout the <span class='second'>e</span>vent</h2>
          <p>Monadic Party is a four-days long Haskell summer school. Our vision is to teach in depth with each talk spanning multiple sessions. Because of the additional time at our disposal we can get deeper into each topic to show a larger part of the story behind the subject.</p>

          <p>We will have three tracks, one for programmers that aren't experienced in Haskell and would like to learn it from the basic concepts. The other tracks are for people already familiar with the language and will present a selection of talks and workshops on a variety of topics. We will announce the list of topics after our call for speakers closes at the end of February.</p>

          <p>For the attendees that arrive on the 17th, and we have a preparty lined up. Check a signup email for more details.</p>

          <p>We chose Poznan to host the summer school because of its architecture, culture and nightlife. The venue is a recently restored lovely old building at <a href='http://mlynska12.pl/' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a> where we have the whole highest floor at our disposal. So the only thing you need is a ticket, laptop and a place to sleep and you're good to go. Catered lunch, tea and coffee is included in the ticket price.</p>

          <p>Check out the <a href='https://2018.monadic.party' class='last-year' target='_blank'>last year's website</a>.</p>

          <h2 class='title left'><span class='first'>G</span>etting <span class='second'>T</span>here</h2>

          <p>We will hold the summer school at <a href='https://goo.gl/maps/DMHV2GN2Nk12' target='_blank'>Mlynska 12</a>, Poznan, Poland. The venue is in the Old Town, a walking distance from a town square. We would love to help you with choosing a place to stay. If you have any questions, please email us at <a href='mailto:team@monadic.party'>team@monadic.party</a>.</p>

          <p>In terms of travel, <a href='https://wizzair.com' target='_blank'>WizzAir</a>, <a href='https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/' target='_blank'>Ryanair</a>, <a href='https://www.lufthansa.com/uk/en/Homepage' target='_blank'>Lufthansa</a> and <a href='http://www.lot.com/gb/en' target='_blank'>LOT</a> all have a dense network of daily connections to and from the city. If you want to save some carbon dioxide, there are frequent train connections from Germany and inside Poland. Buses are also a good budget option with <a href='http://www.polskibus.com/en/index.htm' target='_blank'>PolskiBus</a> which operates a lot of routes in the region.</p>

          <p>Inside the city of Poznan there is a good <a href='http://www.ztm.poznan.pl/en/#planner' target='_blank'>public transporation system</a> with a dense network throughout the city.</p>

              <h2 class='title right'><span class='first'>A</span>bout <span class='second'>u</span>s</h2>
              <p>We're the organizers of <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Monadic-Warsaw/' target='_blank'>Monadic Warsaw</a>, Ewa Kruzynska and <a href='https://twitter.com/monad_cat' target='_blank'>Michal Kawalec</a>. With almost six hundred members it grew up to be one of the biggest Haskell meetups in Europe. We've had speakers and visitors from all over the world and we also host a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeiYYR2fCXarkfSqqFBwuA' target='_blank'>YouTube channel</a>. It is our way of popularizing functional programming and building a community of interested people. We are sure the summer school will give us as much fun as Monadic Warsaw.

              <p>We are deligted to offer a means based scholarship programme. If you are financially unable to attend the summer school, we have a number of fully funded places available. Everything needed for you to attend is covered - travel to the event, accommodation and the ticket itself. The first edition was really successful, so we're really happy that we can continue offering it this year as well.</p>

                This track consists of a crash introduction to Haskell, in two parts of theory and practice. In the theory, we start from scratch and finish with the concepts of functions, type classes and algebraic data types. Armed with this knowledge we switch to the exercise track where we will implement two small games: Snake and Tetris.

              <div class='abstract'>
Students will spend 6 sessions learning to apply practical Haskell programming techniques to the field of cryptography. Together we will explore the fundamental building blocks of modern cryptographic and functional programming techniques. We will focus on domain driven development leveraging the powerful type system of Haskell. Beginner Haskellers are welcomed, but should have a working knowledge of basics, for example function definition and application, where and let blocks. We will explore the following topics: discrete probability, the one time pad, pseudorandom generators, building attacks on ciphers, as well as exploring real world stream ciphers. This will be a fun, and hands on course that will combine lectures focusing on Haskell and Cryptography fundamentals with hands on exercises, projects, and a capstone. Students will leave feeling confident in leveraging Haskell’s type system, writing their own types, using instances of functors, monoids and applicative and take away experience writing and breaking cryptography algorithms.

                In these sessions, Justin will go through various techniques used to make "Real World" applications work in PureScript. Topics will include FFI, using PureScript outputs from JavaScript, and various ways Row Type Classes can be used, whether to create a clean PureScript library or to provide more powerful interfaces for weakly-typed JavaScript libraries. Participants will walk away understanding how libraries like Simple-JSON and React-Basic work.

                <p>In a short talk, it's impossible to dive into details of such large topic as implementing a programming language. Fortunately, there's plenty of time at Monadic Party to discuss some nitty-gritty details.</p>

                <p>We will walk through a "real" programming language implementation, not very sophisticated but not a toy anymore, something like Dhall or Elm.</p>

                <p>We'll discuss parsing various kind of syntax, working with abstract syntax trees, implementation of a type inference, and most importantly: this time good error reporting won't be left as an exercise.</p>

                <p>And if time allows, we'll see what cool features we could add to a language, and what problems that poses to the implementation.</p>

              <div class='abstract'>
                <p>If you are not used to the pure functional paradigm, then dealing with arrays in Haskell can be very unintuitive, the code you write can become inefficient, especially if you choose the wrong library or an incorrect data structure for the job.</p>

                <p>Throughout the series of talks and workshops I will cover some concepts about native arrays that every Haskell programmer should understand as well as provide concrete examples on how to deal with multidimensional arrays using the `massiv` library. First lectures will start with basic topics, such as memory representations and how to properly handle mutation. Then we will transition into more advanced notions of fusion, stencils and other ways of avoiding unnecessary computation, while taking advantage of automatic parallelization. Besides looking at many simple examples we will have hands on experience developing a more complex application that will reinforce the understanding of concepts introduced earlier.</p>

                <p>Haskell is fantastic for industry use. The language can give you some nice correctness guarantees. This peace of mind can make software feel boring (in a good way). I want to convince you of this claim.</p>

                <p>In this talk/workshop series, I'll show you how to write small but useful applications in Haskell. We'll talk about common patterns you need in a production setting (e.g. JSON, HTTP, and databases).</p>

                I'll be giving a tour of the current state of the 'guanxi' library in Haskell. This is a framework I'm building for logic programming in the style of mini-Kanren.

                GHC is getting linear types. I'll cover how you can use them, which of the common functions and classes can be made linear, interactions with other features of the language, theoretical underpinnings, future directions.
